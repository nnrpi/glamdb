# Public browser demo and logos

Published URL: **https://nnrpi.github.io/glamdb/**. Public HTTPS access is enabled
on the fork; Pages source is `gh-pages`, path `/`. Anonymous HTTPS, both logo
checksums and all six public Chromium scenarios passed against this live URL,
including field-based writes, exact int64 values, reads and mobile layout.
Published artifact commit: `c896b5c962cfebbb782e10bbf791894a1aa6678c`, built from
source commit `bc6bf11f4926ef7d8e807e614c160257eeae3205`.
The published index, app/API/model/editor/demo modules, CSS, theme and both logos
match the tested package byte-for-byte.

This mode publishes the same pink workbench as static HTML/CSS/ES modules on
GitHub Pages. A visitor needs only a browser. There is no token prompt, shared
API, account database or local Python prerequisite.

Every page instance owns an isolated bounded BrowserDemoAPI simulation. Visitors
can create fixed-schema collections, append duplicate rows, build typed filters,
read initial/historical snapshots, inspect synthetic metadata and export their
result as JSON. Reset demo or reload recreates the two sample collections.
There is no localStorage/sessionStorage persistence and no API network request;
data is not sent to the project owner's machine or another visitor.

This is a product demo. It is not a network database endpoint, durable storage,
native query/pruning evidence or an SDK server. Full Arrow IPC and network SDK
remain available through the existing authenticated server mode. Browser demo
outcomes are UI simulation records, not C-RESULT durability receipts/canonical
content hashes. Its JSON fingerprints use SHA256 internally only to freeze
request identity within the page.

Limits: 16 collections, 10,000 current rows in total, 128 operation records per
collection, 1,000 preview rows per query, 128 metadata cursor records and a
16MiB conservative retained row/history estimate, plus bounded control records.
This is not an RSS guarantee. Capacity rejection is authoritative locally and
returns definitely_not_committed, allowing a corrected batch. At saturated
control capacity, further failures need not allocate an outcome record; existing
reads/retries remain available and Reset demo starts a new simulation.

## Brand assets

The owner supplied two PNGs, copied byte-for-byte:

- `ui/assets/brand/wordmark.png`: full logo, login and sidebar;
  SHA256 `a2222b67971f388fe2948c18ec9ca9f098a3d25c83a4b3652c10fbfd8eca038e`.
- `ui/assets/brand/mark.png`: transparent database/sparkles mark, favicon/avatar;
  SHA256 `4656feea9c748658ab75b4b36244ccb6822c1869e10cf029e872d13724a7e010`.

Configure paths through `brand.wordmark`/`brand.mark` and sizes through
`sizing.logo_width`, `login_logo_width`, `logo_mark_size` in theme.json. Assets
stay local; unsafe paths fail validation. Old custom themes without logos work.
Colors, decoration and all earlier theme controls remain available.

## Package and preview

From the repository root:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build-public-demo.py
.venv/bin/python -m http.server 8768 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory artifacts/public-demo
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8768/. The build copies only index.html, public assets and
the two explicit theme/sample JSON files. It adds a public-demo bootstrap flag
and .nojekyll. It does not copy .venv, node_modules, .git, tests, server state,
tokens, logs or environments. Output must be a dedicated artifacts/ subdirectory;
rebuilding refuses an existing unmarked directory.

The browser tests also serve the package at /glamdb/, matching project Pages:

```sh
npm --prefix ui test
npm --prefix ui run test:e2e
```

To run only the public scenarios against a deployed URL, set GLAMDB_PUBLIC_URL
and use `-- --grep public` or the public-demo.spec.mjs file. These tests mutate
only their own page instances, never shared remote data.

## Publish

Publish generated assets only to **nnrpi/glamdb:gh-pages**, keeping application
source on the development branch and its upstream pull request. Configure the fork's Pages
source to gh-pages, path /. Never create deployment branches in glamourdb/glamdb.
Use the existing SSH push access; the HTTPS OAuth token lacks workflow scope.
No new privileged workflow or release secret is needed.

For updates: commit the reviewed source/theme, rerun checks, build a fresh static
artifact, copy only that artifact into the existing gh-pages checkout and commit
and push without force. Preserve deployment history. GitHub's Pages build then
serves the new files. Check its deployment status and anonymously open the
published URL after each update. Browser theme preview remains private to a tab;
changing global branding requires publishing the changed public theme file.
